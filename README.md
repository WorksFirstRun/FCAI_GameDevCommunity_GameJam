# Blinded By Fire, FCAI_GameDevCommunity_GameJam
This was part of the Faculty of Computers and AI, Cairo University Game Development Community Game Jam.
The theme of the game jam was Fire.
The name of the game is Blinded by Fire.

Game Idea:
It's about a demon who cursed you with a fire-blinding curse, and you try to find him and kill him to free yourself.
The curse makes you see only a small area of vision, which decays over time.
Your spells also cost vision power.

## Technical Part and what i have learned

# Behavioural Tree
I was learning about behaviour trees before entering the jam, and I developed a custom behaviour tree for enemy AI and player control.


# Object pooling
I implemented object pooling for enemies. Instead of constantly spawning and destroying objects, I pre-spawn them and enable them whenever I need to spawn enemies, disabling them again when they die.



## parts of the code to be refactored
I find that the context class needs to be completely changed. Storing any data related to the enemies or the player in one place is not ideal.

## Conclusion

The game jam lasted 3 weeks, and it took me about 9 to 10 days to make the game. Overall, it was a great experience.
